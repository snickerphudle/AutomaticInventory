Automatic Inventory functions as an intelligent food systems manager that emphasizes the conscientiousness of consumption at the individual level, to mitigate the
overarching effects of food waste at the national level. [aI] uses a neural network based on object detection and image segmentation that takes images of the standard products in your fridge or pantry in order to itemize an inventory of products and their respective expiration dates to create a timeline of use for perishable foods. 

This model has been trained to 98% accuracy with the YOLO v4 object detection algorithm and can classify 5 distinct fruits and vegetables.
